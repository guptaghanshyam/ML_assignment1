    "In machine learning, the process of splitting a dataset into separate subsets for training, testing, and validation is crucial for building and evaluating models. These subsets play distinct roles in the development and assessment of a model's performance. Here's an explanation of each term and their importance:\n",

    "\n",
    "The validation set is a separate subset of the data that is not used for training. It is used during the training process to tune hyperparameters and evaluate the model's performance.\n",
    "Hyperparameters are settings that are not learned by the model itself (unlike parameters), but they affect how the model learns and generalizes.\n",
    "Importance: The validation set helps in preventing overfitting (when the model performs well on training data but poorly on new data) by allowing you to fine-tune hyperparameters. It serves as an intermediary step before testing on the unseen test data.\n",
    "3. Test Set:\n",
    "\n",
    "The test set is a completely separate subset of the data that is not used during training or hyperparameter tuning. It's used to assess the model's performance on new, unseen data.\n",
    "The test set's labels are known, but the model has never seen this data before.\n",
    "Importance: The test set provides an unbiased evaluation of the model's performance. It helps you assess how well the model generalizes to new, real-world data. The results on the test set give you an indication of the model's effectiveness in making predictions in practical scenarios.\n",
    "Importance of Each Term:\n",
    "\n",
    "Training Set: It's crucial for the model to learn from examples in order to make predictions. The better the model learns from the training data, the more accurate its predictions can be.\n",
